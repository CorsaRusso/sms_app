# Navigatr
## About
NAVIGATR uses machine learning and scrapes real-time data to respond to any inquiry you might have when data isn't available to you. We have kept in mind that the main issues that people may have when on the go and running out of mobile data are travel times, bus routes, destination information, and weather information. So, NAVIGATR is able to pull all this information together to allow users to use their phone to the fullest even if they do not have access to mobile data; additionally, we are able to allow users to have peace of mind when on the go - they will always have the information they need to get home safely.
